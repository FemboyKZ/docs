# FemboyKZ Whitelist

FKZ has always run whitelist-only servers, to combat griefing and to keep our servers clean.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who gets whitelisted?

It's compilcated. Friends have priority, see [OG Members](/wiki-fkz/servers/cs2/og). [VIP members & Donators](/wiki-fkz/donators) also get access to whitelist. If you're a content creator or a developer, you get priority as well. Active KZ players are also prioritized, so feel free to link your stats on the request.

### How do I get whitelisted?

You can join our Discord server and request with the `/whitelist-request` command on any channel.

### How do I know if I'm whitelisted?

Run the command again to see the status of your request. You will also receive the whitelisted role once/if your request is approved.

### What happens if I'm not whitelisted?

Nothing, you can just try requesting again later. You can enjoy our Public servers instead!
