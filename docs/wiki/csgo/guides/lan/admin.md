## Adding Admins

As the owner you probably want to give yourself full admin privileges on the server.

1. Open up [SteamID.io](https://steamid.io/) to find your SteamID.

2. Open the `admins_simple.ini` file found in `\csgo\addons\sourcemod\configs\`.

3. Place your `SteamID` along with quotation marks on both sides of it, add second additional quotations after it and set your preferred `Admin Flags` in it.

Example:

```txt
"STEAM_1:1:12121121" "z"
```

See more about the flags [here](<https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_(SourceMod)>).

Save the file.
