## FemboyKZ

Also known as FKZ, is a Community started in 2021 with the purpose of running private, whitelist only CS:GO GOKZ Servers for VNL players.

Over the past few years the community on [discord](https://discord.gg/fkz) (and [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/femboykz)) has reached almost 1000 Members, and our public servers have been used by tens of thousands of players all over the world.

Most of the things made and hosted by FKZ were done so by yours truly, Dotsie :3 I've received the help and support of countless people and am personally thankful for everyone who has either supported, played on or even just talked about FKZ. Thank you!
