# CS2 Binds

This is a list of random binds that I've seen and used. None of these are endorsed or "made/owned" by FKZ. Most of these are movement binds.

FKZ does *not* offer support for any issues with these binds, you may still ask on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fkz), but expect nothing.

## List

- [S1 Binds](/wiki/cs2/binds/s1) - Aliases that make binds function similar to how they do on Source 1 based games.
- [De-Subtick Binds](/wiki/cs2/binds/subtick) - Alias binds that make actions happen every tick instead of subtick.
- [Other/Misc Binds](/wiki/cs2/binds/misc) - Binds that are not in the list above.

## [Guides](/wiki/cs2/guides/binds)

How binds work in CS2, how to create them, and how to use them.
